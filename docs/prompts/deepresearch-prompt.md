# DeepResearch Prompt: Premium Landing Page Design Research

## Context

I am building a premium landing page for a personal transformation/coaching program called "Happiness". The target audience is successful entrepreneurs and executives (primarily men 35-50) who have achieved financial success but feel inner emptiness or stagnation.

**Design Concept:** "Imagine we're designing a website for a Museum of Modern Art that launched a psychological support program for millionaires. It should be strict and minimalist, but with bold art elements inside."

**Tech Stack:** Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, GSAP with ScrollTrigger

## Research Tasks

Please conduct comprehensive research on the following 4 topics and provide detailed findings with specific examples, links, and actionable recommendations.

### TOPIC 1: Premium Hero Sections with Art Elements

**What I need:**
Find 5-7 exceptional examples of Hero sections from premium landing pages (coaches, psychologists, luxury brands, art galleries) that feature:

- Unique text animations (staggered reveals, character-by-character, morphing)
- Integration of photography with graphic/art elements (brush strokes, abstract shapes, paint splashes)
- Brush stroke or paint effect overlays on images or backgrounds
- Scroll-triggered animations that enhance storytelling
- Premium typography with serif fonts for headlines

**For each example provide:**
1. Website URL
2. Screenshot description or key visual elements
3. What makes it exceptional
4. Technical approach (if identifiable: GSAP, Framer Motion, CSS, etc.)
5. How the art elements are integrated with content

**Specific interest:**
- How to overlay semi-transparent brush strokes on hero images
- Text reveal animations that feel premium, not generic
- Parallax effects between photo and graphic elements

### TOPIC 2: Typography Combinations for Luxury + Psychology

**What I need:**
Find 3-5 font pairing combinations suitable for a premium landing page that combines:
- Modern art museum aesthetic
- Psychology/coaching warmth
- Russian language (Cyrillic) support is REQUIRED

**For each combination provide:**
1. **Headline font (Serif/Display):** Name, source (Google Fonts preferred), characteristics
2. **Body font (Sans-serif):** Name, source, characteristics
3. **Accent font (Script/Handwritten):** Name, source, for signatures and personal notes
4. Visual pairing example or reference
5. Why this combination works for "luxury + psychological safety" feeling

**Requirements:**
- Must support Cyrillic alphabet
- Preferably free (Google Fonts) or reasonably priced
- Headline font should feel expensive, editorial, art-gallery-like
- Body font should be highly readable, modern, clean
- Script font should feel personal but not childish

**Reference mood:** Vogue magazine meets therapy session

### TOPIC 3: Premium Preloader/Loading Animations

**What I need:**
Find 5-7 examples of premium preloader animations from luxury brands, art websites, or high-end digital agencies that are:

- Minimalist but memorable
- 2-4 seconds duration (not longer)
- Feature text transformation or morphing
- Include art elements (brush strokes, geometric shapes, abstract forms)
- Set the mood/tone for the website

**For each example provide:**
1. Website URL or CodePen/Dribbble link
2. Description of the animation
3. Technical implementation (Lottie, SVG animation, CSS, GSAP, etc.)
4. Why it works for premium feel
5. Estimated complexity to implement

**Specific interest:**
- Preloaders where text transforms (e.g., "CONTROL" morphs into "HAPPINESS")
- Brush stroke animations that "paint" across the screen
- Elegant progress indicators that don't feel like typical loading bars

**Sources to check:**
- Awwwards.com winners
- Behance premium web design projects
- Dribbble shots tagged "preloader", "loading animation", "luxury"
- CodePen collections

### TOPIC 4: Scroll-Based Storytelling Animations

**What I need:**
Find 5-7 examples of scroll-triggered animations that enhance storytelling on landing pages, specifically:

- Before/After or transformation reveals (relevant for our "transformation table" section)
- Card animations that "come alive" on scroll
- Timeline or roadmap animations
- Text highlight or "marker effect" animations on scroll
- Horizontal scroll sections within vertical scroll

**For each example provide:**
1. Website URL
2. Description of the scroll animation
3. Which section of a landing page it would suit (Hero, Features, Testimonials, etc.)
4. Technical approach (ScrollTrigger, Intersection Observer, Framer Motion scroll)
5. Mobile-friendliness assessment

**Specific interest for our project:**
- How to animate a "Was → Became" transformation table
